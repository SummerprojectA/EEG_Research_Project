**EEG to Text Decoding and Sentiment Analysis**

This research project explores the fascinating intersection of EEG (Electroencephalography) signals and natural language processing. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, we decode EEG patterns to text and perform sentiment analysis, aiming to bridge neuroscience with computational linguistics.

Key Achievements:
GRU Classifier Accuracy: 92.155% (50 epochs)
DNN Classifier Accuracy: 91.568% (50 epochs)
GNB Classifier Accuracy: 65.00%

Features:
EEG Decoding: Transforming brain signals into textual representations.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyzing emotional content from EEG-derived text.
Machine Learning Models: Utilizing GRU, DNN, and Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers for robust analysis.

Purpose:
This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers and enthusiasts interested in EEG-based text decoding and sentiment analysis. By sharing our models, datasets, and methodologies, we aim to advance the understanding and application of EEG in computational linguistics and beyond.

Explore our findings and contribute to the future of brain-computer interfaces and natural language processing.
